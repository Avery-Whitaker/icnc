To install Intel(R) Concurrent Collections for C++, type "./install.sh",
which will prompt you to install the kit into some directory, hereafter
referred to as $CNCROOT.  Note that you must satisfy the
prerequisites listed in $CNCROOT/doc/Getting_Started.htm in order
to use Intel(R) Concurrent Collections for C++.

The Makefiles for the included code samples rely on a CNCROOT
environment variable being defined; this can be accomplished by
sourcing an env-script by "source bin/cncvars.sh" or
 "source bin/cncvars.csh" depending on your shell.

After the environment variables have been properly set up, you can try
building and running the examples located in the $CNCROOT/samples/
directory.
