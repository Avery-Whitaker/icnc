Jacobi2D Stencil

==================================

This program demonstrates using the new cancellation functionality added in
Intel CnC v0.9 to allow computation to end as soon as an answer is found.

In traditional versions of Jacobi2D on CnC, there are a set number of
iterations run in hopes of reaching a threshold in the computation.
Using this "eureka" functionality, we can instead cancel all the extra
computation as soon as we find an iteration has a good-enough result.

By default the "eureka" option is not used. Compile with USE_CNC_CANCEL
to turn on "eureka" mode and cancel extra computation:
    make CPPFLAGS=-DUSE_CNC_CANCEL

The code is not yet prepared for running on distributed memory.
